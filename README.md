# Comprehensive-Retail-Business-EDA-Using-a-Chinese-Supermarket-Sales-Dataset
Developed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project to derive actionable insights from a Chinese supermarket sales dataset. Extracted and transformed sales data using SQL and Python (pandas, NumPy). Applied descriptive statistics to gain initial insights into the dataset.
In spearheading the exploratory data analysis (EDA) project for a Chinese supermarket sales dataset, my focus was on extracting and transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights using SQL and Python (pandas, NumPy). Initially, I employed SQL queries across MySQL and PostgreSQL databases to efficiently extract relevant data subsets based on specified criteria. This process was streamlined using Database Design Tools like MySQL Workbench and ER/Studio to ensure optimized query execution and data integrity.

Once data extraction was completed, I transitioned to Python for data transformation and analysis. Leveraging pandas and NumPy libraries, I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This meticulous preparation was crucial for maintaining data quality throughout the analysis phase.

The next step involved applying descriptive statistics techniques to gain initial insights into the dataset's characteristics. I computed measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution to understand sales patterns across different product categories, customer segments, and time periods. Visual representations of these statistics, created using matplotlib and seaborn, provided intuitive graphical insights into sales trends, seasonal variations, and correlations among variables.

Additionally, I utilized SQL Performance Monitoring Tools such as EXPLAIN and pg_stat_statements to optimize query performance and database operations. This proactive approach ensured efficient data retrieval and processing, thereby enhancing the overall speed and reliability of the EDA process.

By integrating SQL for robust data handling and Python for advanced analytics and visualization, I delivered a comprehensive EDA project that unearthed actionable insights pivotal for strategic decision-making in the supermarket's operations. This project not only highlighted key business trends and opportunities but also set the stage for subsequent data-driven initiatives aimed at maximizing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
